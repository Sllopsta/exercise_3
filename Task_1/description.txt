In Task 1 we compare different order schemes for their accuracy in modelling concentrations. For this, we have plotted the concentration over distance, the absolute error over distance and the % error over distance for each subtask.
Task 1.2 includes no error plots since the analytical solution was not provided.
For Tasks 1.1 and 1.2 we can see that the simulation breaks down instantly once s goes above 0.5, becoming so unstable it produces no valid concentration plots
Tasks 1.3 and 1.4 show no such breakdown, they are unconditionally stable.
It is also good to see that the second order time discretization of Task 1.4 produces better % errors than the first order discretization of Task 1.3
