When we simulate the evolution of the signal with a Courant number of 1, 
we get a stable simulation and no artificial diffusion which could be
introduced due to the truncation error.

The stability analysis states that the courant number has to be <= 1 for a
stable simulation.
The truncation error is dependent on Constant * (1 - Courant).
It follows that the error has to be 0 for a courant number of 1.

When we use a courant number smaller than 1 we introduce an artificial
diffusifity which smoothes out the original pulse.
The amplitude of the signal goes down and the pulse gets a gaussian shape.

With a courant number of >1 we observe an instable simulation.
